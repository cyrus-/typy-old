typy 
====
typy is a fragmentary bidirectionally typed language embedded into Python. 

Information
===========
* The typy.std library implements a number of useful semantic fragments.
* See tests directory for examples.
* See Omar and Aldrich, GPCE 2016 [1] for a description of how typy is implemented.

Project Status and Contributions
================================
The fragment system was significantly revamped just prior to the GPCE paper, so many previously running examples do not currently work. Working on it!

* Subscribe to typy-announce to get occasional updates on the status of typy and the standard library:
